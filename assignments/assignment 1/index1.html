            <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>

            <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
            
            <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
            
            <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are
                classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
            
            <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
            
            <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. 
                Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction</i>:</p>
            
            <p>2H2 + 02 + 2H20</p>
            
            <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<i>H2</i>) and oxygen gas (<i>O2</i>) 
                to form water (<i>H2O</i>).</p>
            
            <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
            
            <p> <b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. 
                It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
            
            <p><sub>Superscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule,
                while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
            
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            
            <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our
                lives.</p>
